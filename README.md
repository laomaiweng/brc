Yet another bitrate calculator for movie encoding

The goal is not to rule them all, but to provide a tool that does not require a fancy runtime (no Java, .NET, ... only Tcl/Tk).
Well, at least that's not a fancy runtime as far as Linux is concerned.

Shamelessly copied/inspired from the tools at [VideoHelp](http://www.videohelp.com/tools/sections/bitrate-calculators), and in particular [Bitrate Calculator by philippe734](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitratecalc/).

Changelog
---------
